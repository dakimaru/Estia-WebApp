					<p><strong>Pricing</strong><br>
						You have the power to decide how much we are going to charge for your place. Have in mind thought, that expensive listings can stay unrented.  It is better if you do a market search to see how much other places like yours are listed and try to be competitive.
					</p><br>
					<p><strong>Title, description, house rules and amenities</strong><br>
						Create your title and description carefully! A great title and description attract more people to your listing so your potential to get your place rented is greater. The amenities section can also be a huge advantage for your place. Amenities such as internet and air-condition are oasis for some visitors.
						Finally we do understand that this is your personal space so you can add your rules or ‘House Rules’, as we call them. You can have rooms that you don’t want people to walk with shoes or you don’t want people at all in there. Maybe you don’t want smokers. Just write it down!
					</p><br>

					<p><strong>Photos</strong><br>
						Well a great photo is the first thing that catches the eye of the visitor when he searches for a place to stay. It is critical for the success of your posting to have a very good photo. You can have up to five pictures so make them worth!
						We know that not all of you are professional photographers but we also know that if you try you can do miracles and we help you providing these articles on how photograph interiors
