				<h3>1. List</h3>
				<p>Creating a listing in Estia is free of charge. You only have to click on ‘list my place’ button on the top of the screen and continue completing the form with your place’s details. Those details will only become visible when you complete the form and decide to make your listin public.</p>
				<p><strong>Pricing</strong><br>
					You have the power to decide how much we are going to charge for your place. Have in mind thought that expensive listings can stay unrented.  It is better if you do a market search to see how much other places like yours are listed and try to be competitive.</p>
				<p><strong>Title, description, house rules and amenities</strong><br>
						Create your title and description carefully! A great title and description attract more people to your listing so your potential to get your place rented is greater. The amenities section can also be a huge advantage for your place. Amenities such as internet and air-condition are oasis for some visitors.
						Finally we do understand that this is your personal space so you can add your rules or ‘House Rules’, as we call them. You can have rooms that you don’t want people to walk with shoes or you don’t want people at all in there. Maybe you don’t want smokers. Just write it down!</p>
